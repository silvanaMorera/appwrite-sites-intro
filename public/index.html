    <h2>Why Appwrite</h2>
    <p>
      I’m drawn to Appwrite because it treats developer experience as a core product
      feature. I enjoy working close to engineering teams, listening to real developer
      questions, and turning those signals into documentation and guidance that help
      developers move forward. Appwrite’s focus on open source, backend fundamentals,
      and community-driven feedback aligns closely with how I like to work and support
      developer communities.
